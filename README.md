Experienced PHP Backend Software Engineer with expertise in building scalable, high-performance systems using microservices architecture and cloud technologies. Skilled in PHP, Symfony, Laravel, and AWS (SNS, SQS, Lambda), I focus on developing robust backend solutions and ensuring code quality through practices like automated testing (PHPUnit) and CI/CD. My experience spans from creating an anti-fraud system, and platform integrations to backend development for commercial and networking applications. Over the years, Iâ€™ve also contributed to leadership roles, coordinating sprints and collaborating with cross-functional teams across various countries. Passionate about leveraging modern technologies such as Docker, RabbitMQ, Neo4J, and MongoDB, I also prioritize code stability with tools like SonarQube, continuously striving to deliver efficient, maintainable, and business-aligned software solutions.
