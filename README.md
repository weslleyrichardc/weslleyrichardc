Iâ€™m a PHP Backend Software Engineer with a product mindsetâ€”delivering solutions that go beyond the initial idea to address what is truly needed, whether for agile startups or large-scale enterprise environments.

I specialize in transforming innovative concepts into fully realized, production-ready products. My experience spans developing robust full-stack solutions in agile startup settings to architecting enterprise-grade systems for big companies. By leveraging technologies like PHP, Symfony, Laravel, AWS (SNS, SQS, Lambda), and Docker, I build scalable microservices that not only meet todayâ€™s requirements but also anticipate future needs.

Even without a formal leadership title, I actively support and mentor my colleagues, fostering an environment where international teams collaborate effectively. I contribute ideas from my hands-on experience, ensuring that projects move seamlessly from concept to implementation with a clear vision and practical execution.
